## SOLID: 

Wichtig:

  * **Single-responsibility principle**
    A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
  * **Open–closed principle**
    "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
  * **Liskov substitution principle**
    "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
  * **Interface segregation principle**
    "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
  * **Dependency inversion principle**
    One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
